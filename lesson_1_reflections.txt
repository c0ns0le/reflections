How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	it gave me the exact addition and subtraction for each edit

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Seeing the total edits can show the direction the project has followed.
	It can also keep project creep under control by showing early directions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Big pro of putting control in the hands of the programmer. Auto systems have
    no knowledge of when you are at a logical point. Con is doing too much between
    commits. Another is forgetting and not having any old versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git understands why programmers use interrelated files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use log to get commit IDs and use diff to see the specific changes. The newest commit
    is listed first. Older commits follow down screen.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    knowing you can go back eases the anxiety of changes. It also makes me excited
    to explore multiple directions on a single project

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Finally overcome my fear of screwing up using git. Kind of ironic that it is
    about helping overcome screwup and that is what I was intimidated about.
