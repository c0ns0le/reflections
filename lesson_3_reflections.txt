When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    This may make sense when you are working on a machine away from your primary workstation.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	That brings things back to awareness of what is happening. If it updates from the remote and you don't know it is happening, you may not look for it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks would be on gitHub with other peoples code. Clones move copies of my and others' repositories to my local station, or even clone on my station. Branch is to work collaborative on the same code, feature explore, or build out new directions.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	THen you can start working on it with confidence it is the best place to move forward from.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Just being able to send each other files without having to remember workflow and commands would be easier. The trail and documentation process makes using git superior. After practice, using git would be the much better solution.
