When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    This may make sense when you are working on a machine away from your primary workstation.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	That brings things back to awareness of what is happening. If it updates from the remote and you don't know it is happening, you may not look for it.
